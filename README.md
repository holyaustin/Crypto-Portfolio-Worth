The Crypto Portfolio worth is a web application that allows users to input their cryptocurrency holdings and track their portfolio value over time. The app fetches current and historical exchange rates to display the total portfolio value and a chart of historical portfolio values in various currencies. It is built using TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
